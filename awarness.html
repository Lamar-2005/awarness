        <h3>Performance Pressure</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>The constant demand for excellence creates a high-pressure environment where athletes feel they must always be at their best. This pressure comes from coaches, teammates, fans, sponsors, and often from within themselves. Over time, this can result in burnout, performance anxiety, and mental exhaustion. Athletes may fear failure, worry about letting others down, or struggle with perfectionism.</p>
      <div class="extra-content">
        <p>It's crucial to recognize these signs early and create support systems that normalize mental health conversations in sports environments. Coaches and teammates play a vital role in fostering a culture where athletes feel safe discussing their struggles.</p>
        <p>Professional support, mindfulness practices, and balanced training schedules can help athletes manage performance pressure effectively while maintaining their mental well-being.</p>

        <h3>Athlete Burnout</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>Burnout is a state of physical and emotional exhaustion that affects motivation and performance.</p>
      <div class="extra-content">
        <p>It often results from prolonged stress, overtraining, and lack of recovery time. Athletes experiencing burnout may feel detached from their sport, experience decreased performance, and struggle with chronic fatigue.</p>
        <p>Prevention involves maintaining work-life balance, ensuring adequate rest, and seeking support when needed. Early intervention is key to preventing long-term consequences on both athletic careers and personal well-being.</p>

        <h3>Injury Recovery</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>Physical injuries bring significant mental health challenges including depression, anxiety, and identity loss.</p>
      <div class="extra-content">
        <p>Athletes often struggle with the fear of not returning to their previous performance level, feeling isolated from their team, and losing their sense of purpose. The recovery period can be mentally exhausting as they watch teammates continue competing.</p>
        <p>Mental health support during injury recovery is as important as physical rehabilitation. Sports psychologists, counselors, and peer support groups can help athletes navigate the emotional challenges of injury and build resilience for their return to competition.</p>

        <h3>Competition Anxiety</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>Pre-competition anxiety is common and can significantly impact performance and overall wellbeing.</p>
      <div class="extra-content">
        <p>Athletes may experience physical symptoms like increased heart rate, sweating, and nausea, along with mental symptoms such as racing thoughts, self-doubt, and fear of failure. This anxiety can be paralyzing and prevent athletes from performing at their best.</p>
        <p>Techniques like visualization, breathing exercises, routine establishment, and cognitive behavioral strategies can help manage competition anxiety. Working with sports psychologists can provide athletes with tools to channel nervous energy into positive performance.</p>
